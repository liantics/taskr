Notes 7-8-2014

Create a to-do list app, named taskr

You can run multiple rake tasks serially from the same liine. Ex:

rake db:create db:migrate

**REMEMBER the colon (:) when generating a scaffold: 
	rails g monban:scaffold

Put the site-wide before action in the application_controller file

----
vim tips:

q: gives you an editable history of the commands you've typed, so you can go up to a past command, edit it, hit escape, and hit enter. This will run the fixed command.

When you type : you can scroll up and down through past commands with the arrows.
